/**
 * The Sound Sensor detects the decibel level: the softness or
	loudness of a sound. The Sound Sensor detects both dB and dBA.
	dBA: the sounds human ears are able to hear.
	dB: all actual sound, including sounds too high or low for the
	human ear to hear.
	The Sound Sensor can measure sound pressure levels up
	to 90 dB â€“ about the level of a lawnmower. 
	the percentage [%] of sound the sensor is capable of reading.
	For comparison, 4-5% is like a silent living room and 5-10%
	is about the level of someone talking some distance away.
	From 10-30% is normal conversation close to the sensor or
	music played at a normal level and  30-100% represents a
	range from people shouting to music playing at high volumes. 
	These ranges are assuming a distance of about 1 meter
	between the sound source and the Sound Sensor
